I've known Rosie Duffield for a long time and we bonded over the fact she was born with an acquired gender. I believe that since puberty, girls and women have different physiology and anatomy. That means that you 
cannot guarantee fairness for transgender women or for biological females when a biological male, or a female, enters that category.

We know from experience that discrimination can and will be costly and time consuming. That is particularly the nature of biological females when they become more common in society. Rosie Duffield may seem small in 
comparison to the magnitude of the difference, but she is also a large woman and we share some of the same biological differences. That is particularly the case with this matter when it comes to physiology and 
anatomy. Given the way our bodies are perceived, it is extremely difficult to say: 'Yes, she has an advantage.' There are so many other factors to take into account.

Budgett - who helped shape the current IOC policy - disagrees. "Laurel Hubbard is an incredibly important figure in the evolution of women's sport," Budgett said. "She is the first step towards creating a 
completely safe, non-gendered sport for women." That is something that has not been determined yet. It's possible, but it's not clear. Given the current state of scientific knowledge, it is extremely likely that nothing has been determined yet.
