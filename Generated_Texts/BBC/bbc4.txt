When the world learned that Trans men and women face disproportionate rates of both physical and mental health problems in some male sports, it raised important questions about the integrity of male and female sport.
While the Olympic body has always insisted that women should be included in the gender category that covers their birth sex, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) says its categorisation of the sexes in 
sport is flawed. Its assessment of transgender athletes, published in the British Medical Journal Open Sport and Exercise Medicine, also considered health impact data. The assessment found that the current IOC policy was not fit 
for purpose for use of modern medical technologies, and that the current Australian policy is.

"There is no guarantee that the next IOC meeting will be based on the Paris Agreement on Climate Change," said co-researcher Professor Ross Tucker. "There is no guarantee that the next meeting of the Group of 
Seven World Economic Forum will be in Paris, or any of the next Commonwealth Games."

Families of athletes who have died from preventable causes could sue the state of Texas, which has a dual-track legal system that runs from July 1 to November 30. According to news reports, the suit could reach a 
maximum of US$5.5 million. The Texas attorney general's office filed a notice of intent to overturn the judge's ruling. A trial challenging the directive is due to take place in July. The American Civil Liberties 
Union (ACLU) had sued Mr Abbott over the directive he had said was to prevent "child abuse". LGBTQ rights advocates say the state's ban on trans people would be a "genuinely benevolent" policy.
