"As a trans woman, I have benefitted unimaginably from the campaigners who came before me who fought for gay rights.They are not forgotten by me," she said. "They are people who changed my life. They are not 
politicians, they are not doctors. They are people who were born male and transgender."

Dr Rachel Levine, 63, was appointed US assistant secretary of health in a 5-4 vote that sent the review to the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, which will investigate the matter. She also voted to allow
 officials from Vanderbilt University to visit families of International Olympic Committee (IOC) player Jarvis de Camp, who recently passed away. De Camp's sister Katie McKinnon was also an athlete and coach 
of de Camp's, and was herself an MOC athlete.

In March, Dr Levine testified before the House Committee on Education, the Budget, and Financial Services. She said she had no choice but to flee during the fast-moving investigations, after being pressured into 
making a false statement about being a lesbian. She added that she believed her brother had been "targeted" by the "LGBTQ(+) community". Chairwoman Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) told reporters on Friday she had 
"turned against the LGBT community" after she sent a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to investigate. In it, she called on the administration to return to its original intent, when it said the law was 
being used "to criminalise minorities".
