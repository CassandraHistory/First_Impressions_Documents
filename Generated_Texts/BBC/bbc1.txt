I've known Lia Thomas for a long time and she has it all. I didn't really understand if I had a future in football, if I had a future in life.

Three seasons ago, she said, "I played girls' football. Girls don't like to be called girls, so they don't like to be called girls. We call them BOPs. We rub them on a somber, clean face." Then, she said, 
"we changed." We asked Tommy Dorfman, the San Francisco 49ers assistant director of athletics, if he was "muzzled" by an anonymous player identifying as transgender.

"No, not really," he said. "It's been said in the press that he's not under investigation, but he's not under investigation." Asked what sort of threats he had received as a result of my reporting, Tommy 
said the following:

"The New York Times was the first to publish what I was told was a false story about them, the transgender actress and journalist ,who appeared in the film 'Robotching Hollywood'. That's not true. I am an independent
 myself, and I am allowed to publish what I have been told by the New York Times and the Washington Post about transgender issues."

On Monday, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) released a statement on my allegations.

"As part of our rigorous review of the existing background checks in all 50 states, we have been reviewing the Texas suit to ensure that the most recent changes have been made to ensure that they do not happen. We 
look forward to responding to any relevant questions.
