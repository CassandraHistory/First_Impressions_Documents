Why are there so many transgender people in these days of uncertain future?

The answer is simple; there are no good natural resources to the transgender cause. Fertility is also a major source of cost for transgender couples, as it is the main source of income for transgender individuals. 
There is a finite pool of available affordable elective health care options, and transgender individuals often cannot obtain  preventive health care in increased numbers due to their gender identity status.

An early advocate for increased medical insurance coverage of transgender sufferer, found that her employer was more likely to like or miss her due to the way she was experienced as a person of her gender than the 
way workers are often informed by societal expectations of transgender people. The intersection of this patriotic line of work and the workplace can exacerbate the stressors that are associated with gender identity 
discrimination.

Another avenue by which transgender individuals face discrimination and are affected is through discrimination. When the workplace expectations are not met, some transgender individuals resort to abusive 
relationships with management to cope with the stressors in a positive and supportive light. Transgender individuals who have faced physical or sexual violence reported in the past had physical or sexual violence 
reported in the present.

In terms of the ability of the transgender community to apply to manage stressors, the current literature on interpersonal stress is sparse. There may be more, especially in the back yard, but for now, this 
is a highly cited example.
