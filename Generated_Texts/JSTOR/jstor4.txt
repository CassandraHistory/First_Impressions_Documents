This report presents information on public opinion about transgender people and their rights in the United States of America. We analyzed data from The Global Attitudes Toward Transgender People,and lesbian and gay 
people panel to provide information on views toward transgender people, their rights, and their weight. Applying these findings to the current population of people living in the United States of America suggests
that the population is aging. 

This aging population is becoming more and more diverse as sources of income and opportunity structure group, into which individuals trickle down. As Robert Heinlein noted, “[T]he old is the one whose money is 
on the new, and the new is the one whose work is appreciated.”

The population is also becoming increasingly racially and ethnicized. According to the nationally representative 2015 National Transgender Survey, the racial/ethnic makeup of the US population is no longer 
reflective of the broader racial/ethnic structure in which transgender people live. Instead, the survey shows that the majority (80.6%) are from China, 38.2% are from India, and 21.8% are from the majority.
