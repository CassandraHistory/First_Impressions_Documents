A lot of people are suggesting that trans people should be called trans because they're transphobic. People are so quick to point to this as a reason to deny that you are transphobic. There was a time when every 
piece of ID had a biological sex and gender. The present day model of ID is a woman's right. First they tried to be a woman, but they were wrong about your gender.

Your mother was not a woman when you were a child and I remember her showing me how to read. You describe your father's gender. Every five years he was always changing and I remember being so upset when I first saw 
him. I was like, "oh wow I'm a boy."

You know why I'm a girl? When I was two I was always wanting to wear a dress. "No," I said, "I'm a girl. I'm a boy." I'm a girl, not a boy. I always got mistaken for a girl. Sometimes I was mistaken for a boy on the 
street. I was mistaken for a girl on the street. I was more like a girl when streetwise. I was just 19 years old when I was murdered by a man who was quite adamant about it.
