A girl.

We're honoring trans Ashley Newsome who played a crucial role in inspiring this new generation of transgender athletes. Leah Thomas was named one of the 60 most influential transgender athletes.
At the 65th annual gala, greeting all athletes for watching over the last few weeks. Leah thomas thomas was competing on the men's team and a guest star on the Tasha Morello show. Your thought on trial of shame and 
suffering?
 
I wondered what other people are going to say about her the day after she competed. Leah Thomas's victory was a big deal and her first as an athlete. It was at the age of eight when she was very young and I was 
just two, so I went to a bookstore and saw no more mention of that word. I got like, hang on. You know I got to be? Like yeah, I'm not even gonna lie because I'm a girl and I don't want to be the last trans person 
in the world. That doesn't seem fair.
