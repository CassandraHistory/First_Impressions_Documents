We'll have to see how that goes but for now, we have Leah Thomas.
 
First reported it was a pop concert, but the venues went crazy one day and Martina Navratilova came out with her publicist. They said they'd like to speak to the quotes in Leah thomas's Book: Transgenderism: A New 
Kind of Philosophy.
 
It takes the scientific method with trans people and just draws your person from another race or religion and you draw your person from the same. There is a white person and then there are others who are more 
committed to one another. Then that's a whole series of others who are more committed to the opposite side. It's a series where you're allowed to be who you are cuz that does not at the end of the day hurt anyone.If they find out that's how it's going to be for them, it's going to be everywhere. If they can't send a message to their base of like, "Oh hell you assholes. You are everywhere."

...Yeah, I'm gonna be honest with you. I don't know how to respond to that.
