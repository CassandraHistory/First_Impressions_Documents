Since being named the NCAA's Most Outstanding Player in last year's NCAA Division 1 women's swimming, she has shared stories of her athletes competing against other great athletes in swimming, diving, 
light swimming, and traditional dog sports. This year, the University of Pennsylvania will hold a double header in the river slushy to mark Transgender Day of Remembrance. And for folks interested in seeing what's 
happening, we've got some great coverage from OutTV Pennsylvania this morning. She joins us now. Now that you know that's a thing, tell us when you first knew that you were meant to be a boy. 

That's something that goes back to when, I think there was a chance a gay bill passed in the Florida legislature. And then there was a bill passed in the Idaho State Legislature that would prevent transgender girls 
from playing on sports scenes or competing against transgender girls.

Is there an application beyond transgender women?

We're always looking at that area, but definitely any time we can contribute to the academic success of transgender female athletes, we're probably right now looking at policies and procedures for treating 
transgender female athletes. We're always looking for ways to improve the school environment, but especially the athletic departments, we're always looking for ways to make sure that we give students a level 
playing field.
