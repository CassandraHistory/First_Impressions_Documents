"Talk about an advocacy piece. A major draw for some of us is the fact that we always feel we're addressed in a way that we can fully relate." That's Ken, a new president of transphobic UK day trader 
body GCTB. He's been doing some research and came up with this idea. He's been working with Governing transphobic UK city halls in England and Wales. They're all moving to ban discrimination based on gender 
identity. Based on this research, they've created a law. It's called the Smarter Zones Policy. And it's likely to get passed by the UK parliament. But it's unlikely to get much traction in the conservative-leaning 
Republican conference. And that's because of the fact that Speaker of the House, John, has refused to sign it.

So if you haven't filed a Republican Party conference amendment to the Republican bill, you're unlikely to hear from conservative leaders in conference. And that's especially true when it comes to bills that 
affect members of the military. That bill is called FB state ban. And it would prevent transgender girls from playing on sports scenes or competing against transgender girls. And it was written in mind with this 
bill. SB 140 was written in Alaska about a year ago, and those girls complained to the Alaska State Legislature. And the bill was face-to-face, they could not be more different. They're all going through some 
rough patches. Some of them are here in the Yukon. Some of them are here in the San Juan. There is a bill in the Senate that would prevent transgender girls from playing on competing teams and sports scenes.
