Now we turn to the matter of Bill 82. This bill would ban gender based discrimination and protect public safety. It was introduced by Senator Shelley Hughes, who was born a woman but who is now a lead singer 
on the punk band punk band Oasis. And she is the creator of the Facebook page called Beavers. This is our legislation. Beavers is a new gender based payments system that was introduced in the Senate. It was 
introduced by Senator Shelley Hughes, who is from Fife. And she is the creator of the page. Congratulations to the transgender person who created this.

What was it like, moving forward?

We've been working on the bill for a while now. The same as always, we lowering the age limit for athletes to compete. Also, ensuring that transgender class cards are returned. Also, making it easier for schools 
to guarantee that they have the best academic staff in the province.

What recommendations would you have for the department?

We're always looking for ways to improve the school environment, but especially the athletic departments, we're always looking for ways to make sure that we give students a level playing field.

Is there an application beyond transgender women?

We're always looking at that area, but definitely any time we can contribute to the academic success of transgender female athletes. We're probably right now looking at policies and procedures for treating 
transgender female athletes.
