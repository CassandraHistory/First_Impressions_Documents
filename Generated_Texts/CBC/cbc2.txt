Top American news organizations are weighing in on the matter. Thirty organizations received a certified mail-in letter from the U.S. Department of Education yesterday, with information about how to prevent sexual 
assaults and harassment. Thirty organizations received a seven paragraph letter from the department yesterday, with a brief history of their support for trans people.

This is the first six week recall action group for the transgender community. We're seeing quite a bit of the same stuff. Here are a couple of the responses:

1. This is definitely not a bipartisan group.

This is not someone that just dominated in the races here, we didn't challenge any of our edge arguments. We dominated in the polls here, we didn't challenge any of our edge cases. But we're not really considered
as one of the organizations that will be competing against cisgender people in the races here. So yeah, we're not squeamish about it. We're not easily swept up in it. And I think it will be interesting to see if 
theres any, if any, barriers that we can look at and contribute to and increase diversity in the classroom. So, it is truly not trivial. I'm not debating whether to raise it or not. That's up to the individual 
athletic department. It's a non-profit organization. But we're definitely not considered as a lobbyist for the sports team. Not even close. Not even within the department.
