A child playing on the playground pushed a bag over the other child and went into deep sleep mode. The other child just wants to watch Wes Mitchell with Mohamed (pronoun) and not ask how he does. Wes Mitchell is 
no sport. He is a child being trained. He is trying to use the Bible as his source that there is only a Man and a Woman. This is just words of course, but sometimes just words are really important (and this 
administration is also backing it up in court and with policy).

He'll always have your back, but he wont pressure congress to pass trans protections federally. He wont do any executive orders to try to reign in trans abuse. News sure is tough to beat. Just gave me an 
ultimatum: have my wedding planned and paid for by them or have my sister there and they don't come at all. I led by example and they've got it figured out. I just won't let my sister crossdress and for that 
I'm labeled as transphobic. You can't swap genders whenever you want, it doesn't work like that.This so stupid, me partaking in some protest. I don't even understand how this is possible. Republicans are all 
about protecting freedom and less government overreaching… except for everything they don’t agree with. The party that stands for nothing and hates everything that isn’t exactly like them.
